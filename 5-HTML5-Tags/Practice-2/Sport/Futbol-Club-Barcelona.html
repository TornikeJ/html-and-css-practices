            <h3>2008–2012: Guardiola era:</h3>
            <p>
                Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard's duties at the conclusion of the season. 
                Guardiola brought with him the now famous tiki-taka style of play he had been taught during his time in the 
                Barcelona youth teams. In the process, Guardiola sold Ronaldinho and Deco and started building the Barcelona
                team around Xavi, Andrés Iniesta and Lionel Messi.

            <h3>2014–present: Bartomeu era:</h3>
            <p>
                On 22 July 2013, Gerardo "Tata" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season. 
                Barcelona's first official games under Martino were the home and away legs of the 2013 Supercopa de 
                España, which Barça won 1–1 on away goals. On 23 January 2014, Sandro Rosell resigned as president 
                by the admissibility of the complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar. 
                Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term in 2016.
