                Captain America is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel 
                Comics. Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain
                America Comics #1 (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics.

            <h3>Creation:</h3>
            <p>
                In 1940, writer Joe Simon conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character
                in costume. "I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page," Simon said in his 
                autobiography, and then decided: No, it didn't work. There were too many "Supers" around. 
                "Captain America" had a good sound to it. There weren't a lot of captains in comics. 
                It was as easy as that. The boy companion was simply named Bucky, after my friend Bucky 
                Pierson, a star on our high school basketball team.

            <h3>Golden Age:</h3>
            <p>
                Captain America Comics #1 — cover-dated March 1941 and on sale December 20, 1940, a year 
                before the attack on Pearl Harbor, but a full year into World War II — showed the protagonist punching
                Nazi leader Adolf Hitler; it sold nearly one million copies. While most readers responded 
                favorably to the comic, some took objection.
