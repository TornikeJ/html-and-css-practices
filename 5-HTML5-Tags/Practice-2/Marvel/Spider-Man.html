                Spider-Man is a fictional superhero created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko. 
                He first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of 
                Comic Books. He appears in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, as well as in a number of 
                movies, television shows, and video game adaptations set in the Marvel Universe.

            <h3>Creation and development:</h3>
            <p>
                In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was 
                casting about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage
                 demand for comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.

            <h3>Commercial success:</h3>
            <p>
                A few months after Spider-Man's introduction, publisher Goodman reviewed the sales figures for that 
                issue and was shocked to find it was one of the nascent Marvel's highest-selling comics. A solo ongoing 
                series followed, beginning with The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (cover-dated March 1963). The title eventually 
                became Marvel's top-selling series[9]:211 with the character swiftly becoming a cultural icon; a 1965 
                Esquire poll of college campuses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero 
                the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons.
