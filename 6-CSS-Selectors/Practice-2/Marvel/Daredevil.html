                Daredevil is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
                Daredevil was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with an unspecified amount
                of input from Jack Kirby. The character first appeared in Daredevil #1 (April 1964).

            <h3>1960s:</h3>
            <p>
                The character debuted in Marvel Comics' Daredevil #1 (cover date April 1964), created by 
                writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Bill Everett, with character design input from Jack Kirby, 
                who devised Daredevil's billy club. Writer and comics historian Mark Evanier has suggested 
                without confirmation that Kirby also designed the basic image of Daredevil's initial costume, 
                though Everett modified it. That original costume design was a combination of black, yellow,
                 and red, reminiscent of acrobat tights.

            <h3>Powers and abilities:</h3>

                Although the character is blind, his remaining four senses function with superhuman accuracy and 
                sensitivity, giving him abilities far beyond the limits of a sighted person. Few characters know 
                that the hero cannot see. Daredevil developed a radar sense,[85] which is similar to echolocation.
