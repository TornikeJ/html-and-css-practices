            <p>
                In the "Civil War" storyline, after the actions of inexperienced superheroes the New Warriors result 
                in the destruction of several city blocks in Stamford, Connecticut, there is an outcry across America 
                against superhumans. Learning of the Government's proposed plans, Tony Stark suggests a new plan to 
                instigate a Superhuman Registration Act. The Act would force every superpowered individual in the U.S. 
                to register their identity with the government and act as licensed agents.
