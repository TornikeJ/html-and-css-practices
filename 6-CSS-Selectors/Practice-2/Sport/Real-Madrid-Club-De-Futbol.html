            <h3>Florentino Pérez era (2009–present):</h3>
            <p>
                On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency. Pérez continued with the Galácticos 
                policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pound sterling) sum 
                of £56 million, and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester 
                United for £80 million.

            <p>
                On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year
                deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[71] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited 
                transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was 
                reportedly the new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million. 
                In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid won the Copa del Rey, with Bale scoring the winner
                in the final against Barcelona. On 24 May, Real Madrid defeated city rivals Atlético Madrid in the 2014 
                Champions League Final.
