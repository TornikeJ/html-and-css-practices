            <h3>Colours and badge:</h3>
            <p>
                For much of Liverpool's history its home colours have been all red, but when the club was founded
                its kit was more like the contemporary Everton kit. The blue and white quartered shirts were used
                until 1894, when the club adopted the city's colour of red. The city's symbol of the liver bird
                was adopted as the club's badge in 1901, although it was not incorporated into the kit until 1955.

            <h3>Stadium:</h3>
            <p>
                Anfield was built in 1884 on land adjacent to Stanley Park. It was originally used by Everton before 
                the club moved to Goodison Park after a dispute over rent with Anfield owner John Houlding. Left with 
                an empty ground, Houlding founded Liverpool in 1892 and the club has played at Anfield ever since. 
                The capacity of the stadium at the time was 20,000, although only 100 spectators attended Liverpool's 
                first match at Anfield.
