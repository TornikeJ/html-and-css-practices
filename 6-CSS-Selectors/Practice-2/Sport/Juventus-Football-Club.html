                Juventus Football Club, colloquially known as Juve is an Italian professional football club based in 
                Turin, Piedmont. Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white 
                striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest
                being the 41,507-capacity Allianz Stadium.

            <h3>European stage:</h3>
            <p>
                The Trapattoni era was highly successful in the 1980s and the club started the decade off well, winning 
                the league title three more times by 1984. This meant Juventus had won 20 Italian league titles and 
                were allowed to add a second golden star to their shirt, thus becoming the only Italian club to achieve 
                this.

            <h3>Calciopoli scandal:</h3>
            <p>
                Fabio Capello was appointed as Juventus' coach in 2004 and led the club to two more consecutive Serie A 
                first places. In May 2006, Juventus became one of the five clubs linked to a 2006 Italian football 
                scandal, the result of which saw the club placed at the bottom of the league table and relegated to 
                Serie B for the first time in its history. The club was also stripped of the 2005 title won under 
                Capello, while the 2006 title, after a period sub judice, was assigned to Inter Milan.
